# fast.ai-Practical-Deep-Learning-for-Coders
My repository for fast.ai's course [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) from fast.ai.

Based on assignments from https://github.com/fastai/course22

All projects are using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

Lesson 02f is using putting 'Is it a bird, plane or Superman' app on HuggingFace Spaces.  Here is the [URL](https://huggingface.co/spaces/William-Tan/bird-plane-superman) for this app on the web.

Have fun learning AI.
